# Calculator
Java Calculator Task

This Java code prompts the user to enter a mathematical expression with different operands and an operator (+, -, *, /). It then evaluates the expression based on the operator entered and outputs the result. If the user enters an invalid input (a string instead of a valid mathematical expression), the code throws an exception and exits.

It took me way long time to complete this task, than I expected :)
